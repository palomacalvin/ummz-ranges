This repository documents scripts made in Claris FileMaker Pro 20 for use in the University of Michigan Museum of Zoology
for the RANGES project (https://ranges-network.org/). The goal of this project is mobilize mammalian trait data
for use in research and education. The scripts available are for use in wrangling container fields with images in
a FileMaker database and capturing image filename metadata. Please feel free to adapt these for your own use in
FileMaker.
